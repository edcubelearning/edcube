Although EdCube is completely open-source, like many other projects, we face the issue of pirating our software without keeping the MIT License. This is merely a friendly reminder that pirating software without the given license, even open-source software, is illegal, and our legal team will not hesitate to inform all parties involved with the pirating of our software without license with a cease and desist.

EdCube relies completely on donations and advertisements to keep it going. EdCube is a massive project and it requires maintenance and support from many branches and teams. We would like to thank many of our sponsors, supporters, and teams at EdCube Studios for all they have done to help us.

For representation purposes only, EdCube Studios Incorporated is comprised in the following structure as of October, 2024: There are two branches, the game branch and the associated product branch. The game branch is where we have 9 different teams working on our main game website. These eight teams are our general projects, marketing, frontend development, backend development, server storage, client support, business support, social media, and external connections teams. The associated projects branch takes care of CUBE0 AI, CubeProxy, and EdCube Tech Tips, and has just two teams dedicated to it, the full-stack development team, and the product management team. The associated projects branch recieves support from teams at the game branch for marketing and other developments.
